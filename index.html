Beyond Product Design, I dive into Motion Design, Brand Design, and even dabble in Creative Coding. If needed, I can hire, mentor, and grow a team." },

            whyDesigner: { title: "Design Passion", icon: "brush", content: "I’m a designer at heart because design is the art of problem-solving. It’s a way to make meaningful, even if small, improvements to people’s lives.\nI love the creative process—the ability to bring something into the world that didn’t exist before.\nAnd at its core, design is a puzzle, one that’s both challenging and deeply satisfying to solve." },

As both a user and a designer, I love that the web is endlessly adaptable, evolving with needs rather than dictating them.<br>That said, I also enjoy the creative constraints of designing for more focused environments—whether it’s a smartphone, a dashboard, or even a kitchen appliance display." },
